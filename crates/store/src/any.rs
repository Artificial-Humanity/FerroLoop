//! One handle for either store engine.
//!
//! Every command, the hub and the wire daemon open their store through
//! [`open_store`] and hold an [`AnyStore`], so the engine behind a store is
//! chosen in one place. `AnyStore` implements all thirteen store traits by
//! delegation and carries the inherent methods callers use beyond them.
//!
//! * The engine is chosen by [`choose_backend`]: a `.fls` path is always a
//!   [`FerroStore`]; any other path takes `FL_STORE_BACKEND` (`redb` or
//!   `ferro`), then [`DEFAULT_BACKEND`].
//! * A logical path such as `fl.redb` names the same store under either
//!   engine: [`physical_path`] maps it to the sibling `fl.fls` when the engine
//!   is FerroStore, so a config entry never changes at cutover.
//! * A scan that only asks [`AnyStore::owns`] ([`Unmigrated::UseRedb`]) opens
//!   a lone `.redb` read-only first and falls back to today's ordinary open
//!   only when the read-only open fails for a non-busy reason (so, as before
//!   this module existed, that fallback can repair a crash-damaged redb or
//!   initialise an empty file). It never migrates.
