//! State-entry search over either store engine.
//!
//! Two legs are fused by reciprocal rank:
//!
//! * the **lexical leg** is the exact field-weighted BM25 of
//!   `fl_core::state::search_state_entries`, run over *every* entry the caller
//!   passes, on both engines. It never drops a match, applies the pinned and
//!   lifecycle weights, and is the whole answer on redb;
//! * the **vector leg** exists on FerroStore only. It queries FerroStore's
//!   HNSW index of `fl_core::embed` vectors, so a typo or a different word
//!   form can still find an entry.
//!
//! Fused score = `1/(60 + rank_lex) + 1/(60 + rank_vec)` (ranks are 1-based;
//! an id missing from a leg adds nothing for it), multiplied by
//! `fl_core::rank_weight`. Every lexical hit is kept. A vector-only hit is
//! kept only if the entry sits close to the query in the embedding space
//! (the embedder is a hashed lexical/subword model, not a learned semantic
//! one, so a bare nearest neighbour is noise).
//!
//! No document collection of entry text is mirrored: lexical search needs
//! none, so no text of an entry is copied into the store. What is written is
//! one vector per entry in a per-embedding-space collection (metadata `rev`,
//! the entry's head revision, and `space`, both as numbers), plus one small
//! index document per collection mapping entry id to `rev`. Every read of the
//! engine costs time proportional to the store, so staleness is decided from
//! that one document in one read, never by probing vectors one by one.
//!
//! **Sensitive entries are never indexed** (`sensitive || ever_sensitive`):
//! a vector is a lossy but real copy of the text, so those entries are found
//! by the lexical leg only, and a vector left over from before an entry
//! became sensitive is deleted on the next [`IndexPolicy::Sync`] search.
//! Vector hits for them are also dropped at read time.
//!
//! That cleanup works from the index document, so the document is written
//! *ahead* of the vectors: before a batch is upserted its ids are listed with
//! a placeholder revision, and the real revisions replace them afterwards. A
//! crash, an error part-way or a concurrent writer therefore leaves a
//! committed vector listed, never orphaned. As a second line, a sensitive
//! entry the document does not list is probed once and its vector deleted if
//! one exists. FerroStore has no compare-and-swap on a document, so two
//! processes syncing at once can still overwrite each other's document; the
//! merge on write narrows that window and the placeholder and the probe cover
//! what it leaves.
//!
//! The caller decides which entries may be shown: only ids in the `entries`
//! slice are ever returned, however much the store holds. A failure on the
//! FerroStore path never fails the search; it falls back to BM25 and sets a
//! fixed [`RankedHits::note`].
//!
//! Limits of the vector leg: it asks the index for the `max(200, entries)`
//! nearest vectors of the whole collection, so a vector-only match can be
//! missed in a store holding many more indexed entries than were passed, and
//! an entry not yet indexed (see [`IndexPolicy`]) is found lexically only.
